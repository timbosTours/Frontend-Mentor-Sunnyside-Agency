## Overview

This was my first project using Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind. As I expected it was heavy on the tailwind but an easy introduction into Next.js and Typescript. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I went with a mobile first approach starting at the top with the nav and the banner. Working my way down to the footer and then adding media queires with tailwind to create a truly responsive website. finishing off with effects and most importantly accessibility. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)


### What I learned

- I learned Tailwind can make for some messy components, but the mess can be reduced with; [Inline-fold](https://github.com/moalamri/vscode-inline-fold)

- I learned that Typescript is pretty easy to just turn on and learn as you go.

- I learned that Next.js gives you SEO benifits on top of a react app.


### Continued development

Th fonts don't render perfectly all the time. 


### Useful resources

- [Underline](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/1936) - This helped me get around tailwind to create a rounded underline.
